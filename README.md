With this project you are able to search after some specific topic and pull articles side-by-side from Wikipedia using its API.

The agile user stories were:
    1.Users can type queries in a search box and view the resulting Wikipedia entries.
    2.Users can view random Wikipedia articles by clicking a button.


I took most some of the design ideas from Google's homepage. I created a headline(using a WIkipedia logo), search box and buttons below. All of the attributes are located at the centre of the page. The “I’m Feeling Lucky” button sends you to a random Wikipedia Page which fulfilled the second user story.


The results after the search are displayed below the search box and the buttons. The user can click on some of the result and with the attribute "target="_blank_"  the linked document opens in a new window or tab
